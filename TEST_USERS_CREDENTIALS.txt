SECURITY NOTES
=====================================

⚠  IMPORTANT:

1. These are TEST credentials only
2. Change passwords after testing:
   - Go to profile settings
   - Click "Change Password"
   
3. For production:
   - Use strong passwords (12+ chars)
   - Enable two-factor authentication
   - Regularly audit user access
   
4. Delete test users before going live:
   python manage.py shell
   >>> from accounts.models import User
   >>> User.objects.filter(username='client').delete()
   >>> exit()

=====================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
=====================================

If login fails:
1. Check user exists:
   python manage.py shell
   >>> from accounts.models import User
   >>> User.objects.filter(username='admin').exists()
   >>> exit()

2. Reset password:
   python manage.py shell
   >>> from accounts.models import User
   >>> user = User.objects.get(username='admin')
   >>> user.set_password('Admin@123')
   >>> user.save()
   >>> exit()

3. Check role is set:
   python manage.py shell
   >>> user = User.objects.get(username='admin')
   >>> print(user.role)
   >>> exit()

=====================================

Example: sales / Sales@123
